# To simply copy files use the following: copy srcfile destfile
# To do conversions we'll need something complex.
# I was thinking of something like: convert crop=wxh+x+y resize=wxh flip=h/v append=h/v srcfile srcfile2 srcfileN destfile
# Multiple files will only be accepted when append is present.
# It's worth noting as well that "commands" will be executed sequentially so you can choose to perform a flip before an append or vice-versa
# This _should_ handle all of the weird cases you need.
